  <p><h3></h>Information and Processing on the Web</h3>
    Information is passed from the server to the browser. This information may be in the form of HTML documents, 
    GIF files, Excel spreadsheets, movies ‚Äî just about any digital content. 
    Information can also be passed from the browser to the server. When you click on a hyperlink you are sending 
    information to the server, and when you fill in an online form, you are usually sending information to the server. 
  </p>
    In addition to passing information backwards and forwards, some processing can also be done in the browser. For 
    instance, you might have a simple Web page that calculates the overall cost of a loan once the initial value of the 
    loan, the interest rate and the length of the loan have been entered. 
    But where does the processing take place? Does the server process the information and generate the result, or is it 
    the client that processes the information? If the client does the processing, then this is a client-side application; if it 
    is the server, it is a server-side application. 
    <p>
    In the loan example above, the client has the information (the principle, rate and time). It could send this information 
    to the server to process the information, generate the result and send it back to the client. Alternatively, the server 
    could send a program to the client that will carry out the processing. In the latter case, since the client has all the 
    information and the program is pretty small, it is probably better to run the application on the client side. 
    Of course, there is also a problem of who has the information. If the server has a database, and the client wants to 
    query it, then there are two possibilities. The server could send the database and the querying program to the client 
    to process it or the server could process it and simply send the result. In this case, it would probably be better to do 
    the processing on the server side.</p>

<h3>Navigation Difficulties </h3>
<ul>
<li>Navigation is the main drawback of hypertext. As the document is interlinked and may loop, readers can easily 
lose track of where they have been and where they are. The freedom to choose to follow any of the links may 
take the reader away from the item being sought. There are insufficient clues as to where an anchor links to. 
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
No Main Catalogues 
A catalogue is readily available in a physical library and the user can easily find out whether the book he requires 
is available or not. It is difficult to index a hypertext document due to multiple links within a document, unless 
the reader is guided to a certain sequence of links. 
Therefore, extraction of required information is tedious, especially in large hypertext documents. Search 
facilities attempt to make this easier. However, when searching a large content of information, such as the Web, 
the results of the search itself may be extensive. Moreover, these search facilities usually only recognise text 
descriptions and not the multimedia content of the document. This undermines the benefits of hypermedia. 
</li>
<p></p>
<li>Link Fossilisation 
Computer names may change and linked documents can be moved to other host computers. Hypertext requires 
explicit pointers to the names of the computers and the files on these computers, or the fragment of 
information that is linked to will no longer be accessible.
</li>
</ul>
